ICML 2023 Topological Deep Learning Challenge
=====================
Welcome to the ICML 2023 Topological Deep Learning Challenge, hosted by the second annual `Topology and Geometry (TAG) in Machine Learning Workshop <https://www.tagds.com/events/conference-workshops/tag-ml23>`_ at ICML. 

Lead organizers: Mathilde Papillon and Nina Miolan (UC Santa Barbara).


Description of the Challenge
-------------

The purpose of this challenge is to fostor reproducible reasearch in YOpological Deep Learning, by crowsourcing the open-source implementation of neural networks on topological domains. Participants are asked to contribute code for a previously existing Topological Neural Network (TNN), and test it on a toy dataset. 

Implementations and are built using TopoModelX, a Python package for deep learning on topological domains. Each submission takes the form of a Python script defining a layer of a given TNN, and a Jupyter Notebook implementing and testing a TNN built with this layer. The TNN layer leverages the coding infrastructure and building blocks from the package `TopoModelX <https://github.com/pyt-team/TopoModelX/tree/main/topomodelx>`_. Participants submit their Python script and Jupyter Notebook via `Pull Requests (PR) <https://github.com/pyt-team/TopoModelX/pulls>`_ to this GitHub repository, see Guidelines below.

Every submission respecting the submission requirements will be included in a white paper summarizing findings of the challenge. Participants will have the opportunity to co-author this publication.

**Note:** *We invite participants to review this file regularly, as details are added to the guidelines when questions are submitted to the organizers.*

Deadline
-------------
The final PR submission date and time must take place before **July 13, 2023 at 16:59 (Pacific Standard Time)**.
Participants are welcome to modify their Pull Request until this time.

Winners announcement
-------------
The first three winners will be announced at the ICML 2023 TAG in Machine Learning Workshop and advertised through the web. Winners will also be contacted direactly via email.
